#summary How to track your friends' online activity

The `ActivityStream` class makes it easy to keep track of things your friends do online, like making blog posts and Twitter updates, etc.  It's super simple:

{{{
from foaflib.classes.person import Person
from foaflib.utils.activitystream import ActivityStream

# Fetch the FOAF profile of the friend to watch
p = Person("http://www.bill.bloggs.net/foaf.rdf")

# Create an ActivityStream object for that friend
stream = ActivityStream(p)

# Iterate over the latest things they've done:
for event in stream.get_latest_events():
    event_handler(event)
}}}

Each value of `event` in that final loop is an instance of the `AcctivityStreamEvent` class.  This is a very simple class with four attributes:

  * `type` - A string conveying what type of event this is - like "Blog post" or "Twitter", etc.
  * `detail` - A string that explains the gist of the event - like the title of a blog post, or a Twitter status, etc.
  * `link` - A string holding the URL for this event - like the URL of a blog post
  * `timestamp` - A `time.struct_time` instance representing the time of the event

That's all there is to it!
